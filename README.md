##### What's the problem?
COVID-19 has launched the world into the midst of unprecedented time. Educational institutions in the most affected areas are transitioning to virtual learning to limit the spread of the Coronavirus. Remote learning can be difficult to normalize due to the lack of one-on-one interaction between student and instructor and the lack of direct assistance and explanation from the instructor may prevent students from assimilating the concepts to the fullest extent. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize those factors by ensuring students can receive counseling from their academic advisors whenever they need assistance. Academic advisors provide one to one support and guidance for students to achieve their academic and career goals. The pandemic is making many students feel anxious about their career and academic future. Virtual sessions with career counselors have become sacred due to high demand.  




##### Describe the technology project you created: #####
We created a prototype aimed at solving the mentioned problem, for which we leveraged IBM Watson in our project. It is basically a Chatbot that gathered different channels of information. By identifying the keyword that users type in, it automatically outputs the answer from its database. There are three main parts of our Chatbot, first is self-exploration, second is academic exploration, and the third is career exploration. Users will navigate whichever they would like to explore based on the hint information. In the self-exploration part, we use a personality test that integrated Watson personality insight to analyze individual personality, based on which our Chatbot will not only have a detailed interpretation of their result but also recommend potential careers for them. Next in the academic exploration part, users can both learn about the major they are interested in and get the required skills for the major. To learn about your major, information regarding major popularity, major role, future projection, and graduate rate are provided. To get the required skills information, some filtered channels will be provided for them to check. In the last career exploration section, it tells users more about the potential tracks of the major they are interested in. In addition, it also shows them some success stories regarding the specific major area, and allow users to get the connection with whom in the story, which provided users more reliable experience. Considering about user-friendly aspect, for most parts, users only need to click on the options button to get the solutions they want.
